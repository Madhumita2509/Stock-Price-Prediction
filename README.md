# Stock-Price-Prediction
Stock price prediction using Deep learning artificial neural networks.
In the field of computation, predicting stock market is one of the most difficult 
tasks. The factors involved in the prediction are physical factors vs. physiological, 
rational and irrational behaviour, investor sentiment, market rumours etc. All 
these makes stock prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree 
of accuracy. Data analysis is a game changer in this domain. As said when all 
information related to a company and stock market events are instantly available 
to all stakeholders and market investors, then the effects of those events already 
embed themselves in the stock price. So, it is said that only the historical spot 
price carries the impact of all other market events and can be employed to predict 
its future movement. Hence, considering the past stock price as the impacting 
factor, Deep Learning (DL)neural network techniques has been employed on 
historical stock price data to infer future trend. DL techniques have the potential 
to unearth patterns and insights we didnâ€™t see before, and these can be used to 
make unerringly accurate predictions. We propose a framework using LSTM 
(Long Short Term Memory) model to analyse as well as predict the future growth 
of a company and an analytical website has been built using dash framework for 
stock analysis.
